## Special Course in Human Brain Connectivity
In this course, I would like to learn to understand human brain as (a set of) complex biological networks. Given that the brain contains around **85 billion neurons** and each neuron makes on average **10 thousand connections**, I am endeavouring to decipher its complexity (from macroscale white-matter tracts to microscale cortical circuits) and the relationship between structure and function, as the anatomical structure determines the function, which in return allows for structural plasticity. Understanding the higher cognitive and perceptual capabilities of the human brain, it is necessary to investigate brain connectivity both in its spatial and temporal scale, which is why I also aim at enriching myself with the knowledge of state-of-the-art experimental design in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 

## Aims aka what I want to know about it.
1. My first goal is to learn new methods of connectivity analysis as well as to correctly categorize brain networks from data at hand. If applicable, I am interested in combining anatomical (e.g. DTI structural data) to visualise brain networks and show-case the results. 

2. Assumingly, brain circuit computations can take a long time if the algorithms are inappropriately designed. Therefore, in this course I expect to discover the preferred and most efficient frameworks for network computations.  

3. In the post-analytical stage, I would like to learn how to inspect for lesions and arrive at conclusions about neurophysiological disorders based on the analysed data. 

## Visions aka how I want to apply it.
In my current project, I am analysing fMRI data to define brain networks responsible for the processing of proprioceptive inputs. however, as my interests in studying the brain are rather broad, in the future I would like to focus on connectivity analysis to detect brain circuits for language processing and unravel the unknowns about language comprehension and interaction. Last but not least, with very humble desire, I would love to contribute to the *Human Brain Connectome* project (see [official site](https://www.humanconnectome.org/)).
